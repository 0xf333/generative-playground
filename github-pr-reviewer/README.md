# PR Reviewer

Welcome to the PR Reviewer! This service is designed to help you review pull requests (PRs) on GitHub. It is based on an AI model which will help you in reviewing your PRs

## Review Checklist

Here's a checklist of things the AI model will look for when reviewing a PR:

- [ ] Code quality: Is the code well-organized and easy to read? Are there any obvious bugs or errors?
- [ ] Functionality: Does the code do what it's supposed to do? Are there any edge cases that need to be considered?
- [ ] Testing: Are there tests for the code? Do the tests cover all the necessary cases?
- [ ] Documentation: Is there sufficient documentation for the code? Are there any missing or unclear parts?
- [ ] Style: Does the code follow the project's style guide? Are there any inconsistencies?

## Review Process

Here's a general process to follow when reviewing a PR:

1. Read through the code and make note of any issues or questions you have.
2. Leave comments on the PR to address any issues or questions.
3. Test the code locally (if possible) to ensure it works as expected.
4. Approve the PR if everything looks good, or request changes if there are issues that need to be addressed.
